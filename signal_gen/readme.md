# Synthetic waveform generation functions
- _gen_synthetic_bat.m_  -  generates synthetic bat calls based on synthetic monocomponent waveforms
- _gen_ifpulse.m_  -  creates a monocomponent signal based on a desired instantaneous frequency vs. time
- _gen_ifpulse_test.m_  -  gives usage examples and plots numerical error for gen_ifpulse method
