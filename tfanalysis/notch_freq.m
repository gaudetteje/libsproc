%function notch_freq(T,F)
% NOTCH_FREQ  calculates expected notch frequencies for overlapping echo glints
%
% This function calculates the expected notch frequencies for given time
% delay(s) of 2 or more glints.

% We can reconstruct a TF map of the notches similar to the waterfall display in
% Jim's ONR SOW, or just return the notch frequencies for discrete values.

% See Saillant's SCAT paper, Parks & Allen SCAT review, & Sanderson's equation
